# Evans

Hey guys,

This is the 8th week of our course and the time has come for you to work on a "real" Rails project. One that has existed for a few years, evolved in some way and used daily.

I'd like you to meet Evans. Evans is the system used for Python, Ruby, Clojure and Go courses at FMI. The official repo is [skanev/evans](https://github.com/skanev/evans). I'd like you to clone it and run it. Note that it requires Postgresql and Redis server so you have to setup these first.

Evans presents functionality for managing tasks and challenges as well as a forum where students could discuss different topics.

For this task we'd like you to extend Evans. You have to implement a notification system for the users of the application. Every time a new task or challenge is posted the user should see a notification. This hold true for forum topics the user has posted in too.

For completing this task you'll have to learn the internals of Evans - how the system is implemented, what classes are present, how it could be extended.
